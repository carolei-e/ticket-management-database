The Ticket Management Database is a comprehensive system designed for managing ticket sales, events, and customer interactions. Developed from scratch for a class project, this database integrates key functionalities, including venue management, event tracking, customer profiles, and bulk purchase detection.

Key Features:

Venues: Stores information about event venues, including location details, seating arrangements, and capacity. This ensures efficient venue management for event organizers.

Events: Tracks details of various events, including dates, times, and associated venues. Each event entry is linked to the corresponding venue and customer interactions for accurate ticket management.

Customers: Maintains customer profiles, including personal information, purchase history, and preferences. This section helps in personalized event recommendations and customer support.

Bulk Purchase Detection: Identifies and flags bulk ticket purchases to prevent potential scalping or fraudulent activities. This feature ensures compliance with ticketing policies and provides valuable data for event organizers to manage ticket distribution.

Tickets & Transactions: Allows customers to purchase tickets for events, tracks the status of each ticket (purchased, reserved, or canceled), and records transaction details for accounting and reporting purposes.

Database Design: The database uses relational tables, including venues, events, customers, tickets, and transactions. Relationships between tables are defined through primary and foreign keys, ensuring data consistency and efficient querying. Complex queries enable event organizers to retrieve customer purchase history, detect bulk purchases, and analyze sales trends across venues and events.

This project demonstrates the use of SQL for data management, ensuring a seamless process for ticket purchasing, venue coordination, and customer relationship management.
